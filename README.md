## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
A few apps that I regulary use that have feature that I really like and appreciate are:

- MetaSurf (iOS) [Link](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/metasurf-social-browser/id1599589179)
    - Ability to browse multiple social media platforms in one app and easily change between them while staying in the app
    - The browsing sessions are saved and the user is able to continue from where they left off

- Gmail (iOS) [Link](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gmail-email-by-google/id422689480)
    - User is able to 'schedule' send a email at any time they like
    - User emails are categoriez into different inboxes that allows the user to prioritize which emails they view first
    - Ability to give emails custom tags and group them under one or more categories

- ChatGPT [Link](https://chat.openai.com/)
    - Ability to add custom instructions for later use
    - Pre-written suggested prompts to use for daily tasks
    - Able to use extensions to further enhance user experience
    - Simple and uncluttered UI 


## Notes

A challenging part of creating this app was getting the button action to work. I learned that simply deleting and re-writing the code will not work and that I must create a new button and link it to the @IBAction function. Additionally, I must run the app in a (separate window) apple device simulator rather than click on the button inside Xcode.
